##Social problems
One of the hardest things about maintaining a diet that is completely different from everyone else’s is attending social events. During the week, when I was back in Catalonia, I cooked exactly what I wanted. But on the weekends, while eating out in restaurants or at someone's place, having control of my diet became a real problem.  
Though a lot of the time I could get along by just skipping some dishes or having the surrounding people adapt to my diet, I wasn't always able to stick to it.  
Plus, I love pizza, bread, pasta, ice cream... Sometimes I was just tired of being the weird one, or it didn't feel right to refuse a meal.

To me, it’s okay to eat rich carbohydrates, gluten, or highly processed food once in a while. They are the exception, not the norm. **My main problem was getting out of ketosis**. Depending on what and how much I ate, it could take me few days to get back to it. During this period, **I felt tired and mentally blurry**, and the low glycogen stores prevented me for doing any prolonged exercise without hitting the wall.

##Fasting
Luckily, there is a faster way to get in to ketosis, and this is fasting. So, I started to experiment with fasting after cheating with carbohydrates.  
That means, on Monday (after a weekend of feasting on high glycemic index foods) I don't eat anything. Then, at some point on Tuesday or Wednesday I'll start eating again, being already in ketosis.

That worked really well, and it allowed to be more flexible with the food in general while reducing the time exposed to a non-ketosis state.

Rapidly, it became very easy to go through the fasting period without any "suffering"." Plus, **the time needed to get back into ketosis got reduced with each iteration**.

##Hunger
When I eat a diet rich in carbohydrates, I'm always hungry. And once I start eating, I can always eat more, especially with sugar. I'm a sugar junkie. But when in ketosis, the feeling of hunger is completely different. While your body still tells you that it wants food, it’s more of a *nice to have* than an *I need food right now*. And it doesn't get worst the longer you fast.

People are surprised when I say that I haven't eaten in two days. From their perspective, it seems like something extremely hard to do. And it is—but only in the context of a "normal" diet.  
In ketosis, **not eating for few days is as hard as skipping a meal**.

## Perception
One interesting thing is how the desire for different types of food changes. Rich **carbohydrates are far less appealing**, and vegetables that usually are less likeable felt more and more like the preferred option the longer I was in ketosis.

Smell sensitivity also changes. I especially notice it after more than a couple of days of fasting, or after running long distances. At that point, **I smell food everywhere**. And the smell its reeeally good. I found this super interesting, especially taking in to account that the feeling of **hunger remains low and stable**.

##Reducing intake
With all that, I started asking myself:  
**"How much do we really need to eat?"**  
My body works perfectly still. I'm feeling extremely energetic and my mind is sharp.  
Therefore, I started reducing my intake to the point that I realized that one meal a day was just fine. 

For the last 6 months, the norm has been eating **one single meal a day**.

I don't have any data, since this has been an organic experiment. Still, I could bet that **my intake in terms of weight is at least half of what it used to be**.  
Although, this is not the best way to phrase it, since *what* and not *how much* I eat is what really matters. I eat a lot of fat, so I think the difference in terms of calories may be not that big.

##Consequences
Some interesting indirect consequences came up by eating once a day.

- **I don't get sleepy after lunch**. By not having anything to digest, staying in ketosis provides my body with plenty of resources to keep working.  
- **I save a lot of money (and time)**, especially since we eat out for lunch at my current work place. As a drawback, I lose some precious time to socialize.
- **Dinner has become a very important** part of my day. I take more time to make better meals, and I spend more money on **better ingredients**.
- **I can cheat** pretty much whenever I want. Being in a ketogenic diet, plus having a very low intake, allows me to consume rich carbohydrates in generous quantities with almost no effect.
- Transitioning from mostly glycolysis to mostly ketosis is trivial. **I can go back into full ketosis** in a matter of hours **without doing anything**. 

##Next
As I said before, "how much" may be a misleading way to express this experiment. _**What**_ is what really matters.

While this current model serves me fantastically as I can get the best of both worlds, I'll keep playing with the portions of micronutrients.  
For instance, in the last 3 weeks, while still eating once a day and keeping the same portion sizes, I substantially increased the amount of fat intake (especially with nuts, butter, and coconut oil), and so did my weight. From that I assume that I can eat even less (in terms of total amount).

##Back to society
In first world societies, the main purpose of **food is to please us**. Health only comes into play when problems arise.  
Our bodies evolved to survive in a world of scarcity during millions of years. Only in the last decades have **we lived in a world of abundance**, and with it we have become overfed, spoiled animals. We no longer know what or how much is right or wrong to eat. We’ve lost our natural instincts, all for this little thing that seems to drive our world — **instant gratification**.
