#On hunger and eating one meal day

##Social problems
One of the hardest things maintaining a diet completely different from everyone else are social events. During the week, when I was back in Catalonia, I cooked exacly what I wanted. But on the weekends, eating out on restaurants or at someone's place, having control of my diet became a real problem.
Although a lot of times  I could get along just by skipping some dishes or having the sorounding people adapting to me I wasn't always able to stick to it.
Plus I love pizza, bread, pasta, icecream... and some times I was just tired of being the weird one or it didn't feel right to refuse a meal.

Its ok to me to eat rich carbohidrates, gluten or highly processed food everytime in a while. They are the exception not the norm. My main problem was getting out of ketosis. Depending on what and how much I ate it could take me few days to go back to it. During this period I felt tired and mentally blurry, and the low on glycogen stores prevent me for doing any prolonged exercices without hitting the wall.

##Fasting
Luckyly there is a faster way to get in to ketosis, and this is fasting. So I started to experiment with fasting after cheating with carbohidrates.
That means, on Monday (after a weekend of high glycemic index food feast) I don't eat anything, and at some point on Tuesday or Wedensdeay I'll start eating again, being already in ketosis.
That worked really well, and it allowed to be more flexible with the food in general while reducing the time exposed on none ketosis state.

Rapidly it become very easy to go through the fasting period without any "suffering", and the time needed to get back into ketosis got reduced with each iteration.

##Hunger
When I'm in a diet rich in carbohidrates I'm always hungry. And once I start eating I always can eat more, specially with sugar. I'm a sugar yonky. But when in ketosis the feeling of hunger its completely different. While your body still tells you that it wants food, its more a "nice to have", than a "I need food right now". And it doesn't get worst the longer you fast.

People are surprised when I say that I haven't eat in two days. From their perspective it seems something extremely hard to do. And it is. But only in the context of a "normal" diet.
In ketosis, not eating for few days is as hard as skipping a meal.

## Perception
One interesting thing is how the desire of the different types of food change. Rich carbohidrates are far less appealing, and vegetables that usually are less likeable felt like a preferred option the more in ketosis I'am.

Smell sensitivity also changes. I specially notice it after more than a couple of days of fasting or after running long distances. At that point I smell food everwhere. And the smell its reeeally good. I found this super interesting especially taking in account that the feeling of hunger remains low and stable.

##Reducing intake
With all that I started questioning myself "How much do we really need to eat?" My body works perfectly still. I'm feeling extremely energic and with a sharp mind.
Therfore I started reducing my intake until the point I realized that one meal a day was just fine. 

For the last 6 months the norm has been eating one single meal a day.

I don't have any data since this has been an organic experiment but I could bet that my intake in terms of weight is at least half of what it use to be.
Although this is not the best way to phrase it since "what" and not "how much" I eat its what really matters. I eat a lot of fat so I think the difference in terms of calories is not that big.

##Consequences
Some interesting indirect consequences came up by eating once a day.

I don't get sleepy after lunch. By not having anything to diggest and staying in ketosis makes my body to have plenty of resources to keep working.
I save money (and time). A lot. Especially since at my current workplace we eat out for lunch. As a drawback I loose some precious time to socialize.
Dinner has become a very important part of my day. I take more time to make better meals, and spend more money on better ingridients.
I can cheat pretty much whenever I want. Being in a ketogenic diet plus having a very low intake allows me to consume rich carbohidrates in generous quantities and having almost no effect.
Transitioning from mostly glycolysis to mostly ketosis its trivial. I can go back into full ketosis in a matter of hours without doing anything. 

##Next
As I said before, "how much" may be a missleading way to express this experiment. "What" its what really matters.
While this current model serves me fantastically as I can get the best of both worlds, I'll keep playing on the portions of micronutriens.
For instance, in the last 3 weeks, while still eating once a day, and keeping the same portion sizes, I substentially incresead the amount of fat intake (especially with nuts, butter and coconut oil), and so did my weight. From that I get that I can eat even less (in terms of total amount).

##Back to society
On first world societies the main purpose of food its to please us. Health only comes into play when problems arise.
Our bodies evolved to survive in a world of scarcity during millons of years. Only in the last decades we've lived in a world of abundance, and with it we become overfed spoiled animals. We no longer know what or how much its right or wrong to eat, we've lost our natural instincts, all for this little thing that seems to driver our world. Instant gratification.
