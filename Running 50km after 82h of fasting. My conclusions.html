<p>In the last months I’ve built up a serious opinions about what its right and wrong about our current diets and a lot of it has to do with human evolution and running.</p>

<p><b>The endurance running hypothesis</b></p>

<p><i>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_running_hypothesis">The endurance running hypothesis</a> is the hypothesis that the evolution of certain human characteristics can be explained as adaptations to long distance running. The hypothesis suggests that endurance running played an important role for early hominids in obtaining food. Researchers have proposed that endurance running began as an adaptation for scavenging and later for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting">persistence hunting.</a>”</i></p>

<p>If the previous theories are true, that means we use to hunt by chasing antelopes for hours until the animal collapses from overheating.
Books like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run:_A_Hidden_Tribe,_Superathletes,_and_the_Greatest_Race_the_World_Has_Never_Seen">Born To Run</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Run">Why we Run</a> support the persistence hunting theory, and in my very limited knowledge makes sense to me to. But they fail to explain how these hominids could have enough energy to sustain these ultra-runs.</p>

<p>In the same wikipedia article it says:</p>

<p><i>Such a long hunt requires high amounts of dietary sources of water, salt, and <b>glycogen</b>.</i></p>

<p>To build up glycogen stores endurance athletes do the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate_loading">Carbo load</a>”, that means eating generous quantities of carbohydrates in the hours prior the workout.
If running, this load will last about 2h or 24km before this person “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_the_wall">hits the wall</a>”. That means, running out of energy and collapsing (<a href="http://rnkpr.com/a4xbod1">I’ve hit the wall</a> few times in the past). That’s why they use energy bars and gels, to refill these storages and keep going.</p>

<p>That will be a beautiful theory if it wasn’t because the type of food necessary to build up this storage was pretty much nonexistent or at least not accessible. Just google “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carbo%20loading%20foods">carbo loading foods</a>”. And they were hunting because didn’t have food in the first place…</p>

<p>Only in an state of ketosis we can explain that these ancestors where able to run for an entire day.</p>

<p><b>Research</b></p><p>There is research going on in the field of ketosis and endurance sports. I really admire <a href="http://eatingacademy.com/">Peter Attia’s</a> research. There are lots of other sites under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet">Paleo</a> flag, and also experiments with Ketosis and long distance running, but nothing really related to ultra endurance and few days fasting. At least that I’m aware of. Please provide source if you know.</p>

<p>That’s why I had to try it.</p>

<p><b>Competition</b></p>

<p>By no means I’m a professional athlete. I’ve been in 3 races in my whole life. Its not my goal to be fast when I run, but I enjoy the pressure and preparation that comes with a race. I follow this world quite closely.</p>

<p>Since my last meal until I started running I lost about 4kg. I did not burn that much fat.
My last poop was 48h after the meal. Since then until I started running my weight just decreased 0.5kg. That means I had about 3Kg of food in my guts…</p>

<p>Using glycogen instead of fat its more efficient. It uses less oxygen to do the conversion into energy, but If you’re body weights 3kg less, that’s a lot of energy savings in a long distance race…</p>

<p>People get crazy buying shoes that can save them few grams. Well, how about saving few Kg? Plus you don’t have to bring any gels. And you won’t have any gut problems, and that includes not having to take a shit during the race.</p>

<p>That sounds like a pretty good deal to me.</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p>I don’t know how much of what I accomplished its due to a process of adaptation (for the last months I’ve been eating once a day) and how much is something that we have built in our systems and we can just trigger with the right circumstances.</p>

<p>All my arguing may sound over simplistic, and probably it is. I’ve been following the research on this field for a while and I can barely understand any of the technicalities they talk about.</p>

<p>The key point for me its that <b>IT IS POSSIBLE</b>. And probably way beyond of what I did. I’m not a nutritionist, nor an athlete, and it wasn’t even that hard. My reasoning was simplistic, based on fundamental questions that transcend the details.</p>

<p><b>What’s next</b></p><p>&nbsp;I’m suspicious that there are big differences between nutritional ketosis (induced by reducing the intake of high glycemic index foods) and ketosis induced from fasting. In other runs done in nutritional ketosis I didn’t feel that energetic (but it’s hard to compare since I’ve never done it that far in distance). That’s something I may explore.</p>

<p>I think few days of fasting offer unique areas of explorations. Right now there are a couple of things I’m curious about.</p>

<p>Since there is no input nor output of food, and I can control my hydration very easily I should be able to get an idea of my fat burning rate.</p>

<p>The other thing its related to electrolytes. There is a lot of theories out there that relates the lack of electrolytes and cramping. By taking food out of the equation I will be able to control my minerals intake and I should be able to get some straight forward answers.</p>

<p>And of course, (with extra training) I’ll try to see how much far I can go with less food, or none.</p>
