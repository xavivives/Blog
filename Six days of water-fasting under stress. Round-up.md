#Intro
This post refers to the experiment I did last February. I've been distracted with other stuff and until now I didn't find the time to summarize the experience.
Check the previous updates for more detail:

I make several references to "the previous fasting" or the "previous experiment", I'm referring the experiment I did last November:

*   [Running 50km after 82h of fasting. My conclusions.](http://blog.xavivives.com/post/134198815248/running-50km-after-82h-of-fasting-my-conclusions)

#Original goals
The idea was to do a distilled water fasting for an undefined period of time, while keeping a "normal" lifestyle and moderate exercise.

This is what I wrote on the first post of this experiment:

When I [ran the 50k after few days of fasting](http://blog.xavivives.com/post/134198815248/running-50km-after-82h-of-fasting-my-conclusions), the experiment was pretty much to see if it was doable or not from an energetic standpoint. This time it’s about everything else. But there are few things I'm specially interested in finding out:

*   **General feelings**, body reactions and what feedback it provides.
*   **Effects on running** when there is a lack of **electrolytes**.
*   Effects in general when **no micronutrients are ingested**.
*   What's my **fat burning rate** on my daily basis and in consequence what it’s my daily **energy expenditure**._

#Conditions
[Water fastings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_fasting) are usually done for spiritual or healing reasons and under a very controlled and ideal environment, with no stress, no work, no exercise, good weather...
The purpose of this fasting was very different, and as mentioned, having stressors was desired.
During the week I averaged about 9-10 working hours per day. I did a [23.8 km +666m run](https://www.strava.com/activities/498504818) just before the last meal, a [11km +600m](https://www.strava.com/activities/500374321)  two days later. And a [8.5km +318m hike](https://www.strava.com/activities/503211522)(that supposed to be a run) on the 6th day.  I also did a short 1.5h bouldering session and a 20min high intensity workout. The [weather was about 15ºC  with 80% humidity and cloudy all the time,with few rains](http://www.hko.gov.hk/wxinfo/pastwx/mws2016/mws201602.htm).

The intention was to do a lot of running mileage, at least have a +25km run, but I really couldn't keep up. Last day I could barely get out bed.

#Expectations
Previous experiment couldn't have gone any better. It was just brutally satisfying to accomplish it and because of it I was very optimistic on how long I could stand the fasting and the results that will come out of it.

#Reality
It turned out to be an awful experience. Nothing went as planned. Hypothesis couldn't be tested, and the fasting lasted only 6 days.

I felt bad since the very beginning. Initially  I attributed it to the lack of sleep. It didn't make sense to be related to food intake (or at least not all of it) since I've done +48h fasting several times and never felt that way.

Things got worse each day. I started feeling very tired and with no energy, cold, and couldn't sleep properly, I didn't want to move, my attention span got reduced and my mind was constantly thinking on food and the comfort it will come with it.

#The problem
I've been thinking a lot why there was such a big difference between the previous fasting and this time, specially the first days.
My believe is that my body entered in into a state of "power saving mode" slowing down my metabolism, when it realised that my brain was running out of glucose.
In an [early post of my previous fasting](http://lab.xavivives.com/post/133707935165/why-a-marathon-with-no-food) I mention that I didn't understand why no one was doing long distance running without food intake. My only hypothesis was that if done so, our brain will run out of glucose and... something bad will happen. That was the only bad outcome I could imagine for the previous fasting and it never happened.

_Wrong approach_
This my only intake was distilled water while previously I allowed myself other beverages, _mostly coconut water_.

My argumentation for drinking coconut water was because I was afraid of being low on electrolytes and have to deal with cramps to early on. Coconut water is quite [rich on Sodium and Potassium, but also on Sugar](http://pasteboard.co/XDMrbc5.jpg). As [user Anon pointed out on the comments](http://disq.us/9ufvfi) this could've made a _huge difference_.

_The Hypothesis_
In retrospective seems very obvious but I didn't realise about it until after I ran the 50k:

On the previous fasting the _sugar on the coconut water just kept the glycogen stores full enough for my brain to rely on them, while my body was running on ketones_.

This time _glycogen was never replenished_. I also started the fasting right after a 23k run and no carbs other than an apple juice few hours before was consumed. So, I started the fasting with very low glycogen stores already. On top of that I was lacking sleep...

It seems that even if I was in full ketosis _my brain didn't have energy_, and if the brain doesn't have energy _it doesn't really matter if my body has the fat stores full, the brain closed the tap_.

_Sugar addiction_
I've been wondering why we love sugar so much. High concentrations of energy in carbohydrates and fat is an [established argument](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53561/) for why we evolved to like them. But _sugar stands out over everything else_. It’s been proven [dopamine is released by our reward system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/) when sugar is ingested. But why?

While planning how to deal with my last run on the 6th day of fasting, I had zero energy and no mood for anything, I was thinking that I should try to get a shot of glucose, just to prove if the lack of it was actually the source of the problem or not.

I had to eat something that won't alter my post blood analysis in a substantial manner (no macro nutrients of any kind other than glucose). It feels super obvious now, even dumb, but I don't recall coming across this explanation before and never thought of it:
_Glucose is a sugar_.

_Sugar_ (let's say table sugar, as sugar is a generic word) is pretty much the _purest form of glucose_, and the _single source of energy our brain really needs_. _It makes a lot of sense to have evolved to love it_.

This thought had changed perception of sugar.

#Analytics
I got a blood sample before and after the experiment. I did it for obvious reasons but also to not [get bashed for not checking with the doctor]((https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10931399).

The first analytic was just to have a base line to compare. Everything was great except Urea, which was well explained due I was dehydrated from a 23km run the previous day. Doctor showed a lot interested on my diet.

The second one (6 days later) was te real deal. I was expecting the sodium levels to be low due to sweating. This was not the case and they were within the reference points. The doctor was very surprised as well.
But what freaked him out was the very high levels of Uric Acid. It seems to be a clear indicator of kidney malfunctioning. He begged me to stop the experiment right away (I couldn't keep up anyway). The high concentration of Potassium confirms that something was wrong on my kidneys.

The rest of indicators were great!
By no means I'm someone qualified to understand the results. If you have any feedback it will be greatly appreciated.

#Fat loss
I lost a total of 4kg since the start of the fasting.

You can check the logs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UQPrhwwYjTwiHFrJld90puwU0neW8Cga6Hk4Q-75inQ/pubhtml?gid=559589433&single=true) and the summary [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UQPrhwwYjTwiHFrJld90puwU0neW8Cga6Hk4Q-75inQ/pubhtml?gid=1560899815&single=true)

I was hoping to find out my daily fat burning as well as my daily caloric consumption, but I don't think it makes much sense now:

If we consider only the data after the last poop (4 days of measurements), the total fat loss should be very close to the total weight loss. That's not the case.
My weight loss (measured with a scale) was 3.2% while my fat loss (measured with a body fat caliper) was 0.73%. This is a 4x factor... Unless there is a major flaw in my argument that means that the body fat measurements using the caliper are completely wrong.

On my [first update](http://lab.xavivives.com/post/139793743480/starting-an-undefined-period-of-fasting) I explain the procedure I've followed to get the measurements.

Also considering that my metabolism was running extremely slow and the [Thermic effect of food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_dynamic_action) was null, makes finding the fat burning rate on this context a little pointless.

_Visual evolution_
I took a picture every day to see if there was any relevant visual change on my body. I don't see any.
I also have side pics but I don't think they are much relevant.

#Cramps and electrolytes
I tend to get cramps quite often (usually on my calf muscle), running or after hanging out and drinking to much. Sometimes leaving muscle pain that can last over two days.

It’s been clear to me that dehydration and muscular fatigue play a big role. What wasn't that clear was the role of the electrolytes.
It’s  [been pointed out as cause for cramping](http://www.livestrong.com/article/298392-electrolyte-imbalance-in-kidney-failure/). The imbalance of minerals created due to water and sodium loss when sweating.

The current experiment presented a _unique opportunity_ to throw some light to it. By having _no input source of minerals_ I should be able to see how big of a role electrolytes play on cramping.

Reality is that _I didn't run enough_ to test any hypothesis. Not far, not fast.

Usually I may start getting cramps past 20k (depending on intensity and hydration) but I felt so weak that I couldn't get nearly close to that point. To bad...

#Hunger and comfort
One thing I believe is quite relevant but hard to summarize are all the different sensations related to hunger (specially in this experiment but also in other ones).
There is big spectrum of them. Feedbacks that our body use to tell us what it needs.

We tend to _simplify our desire for food with the word hunger_, but I believe some extra vocabulary for it will be of great use.

It is no secret that food gives us comfort, but in this experiment it became crystal clear to me. Most of the time _I wouldn't describe my feeling as being hungry, but my desire for food was immense._ Sometimes so big I couldn't think of anything else.

When I broke the fast, I wasn't that hungry but I wanted to eat so so bad... This "must eat" idea stayed with me during the following days.

Within the 5 days after finishing the fasting my weight went from 69.5kg to 76.7kg (_the heaviest in my life_).
I did eat a lot, but still, it seems quite incredible to me that the body can absorb that much in so little time.
