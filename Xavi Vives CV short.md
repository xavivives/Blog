## Personal

My exclusive focus now is the long term development of [Interplanetary mind-map](https://github.com/interplanetarymindmap/docs) and the creation of a foundational framework to sustain it. I'm currently publishing and experimenting with using [my site as a first prototype](https://xavivives.com/#?expr=[%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3clzfmhs7a%22,[[%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3c2lf4dbua%22,%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3cwx4lcc2a%22],[%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3c2lf4dbua%22,%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3cmy3c4u4a%22]]]&).

For the last 6 years I've worked exclusively on projects that are 100% open-source and focused on empowering the individual and civil society.

Transparency is a requirement on any project I work, and I've left the most financially rewarding projects because of that. I purpose, sometimes at my personal cost and I'm not looking at economic reward at the cost of others.

In the past I've led several projects, developing good skills for organizing all sort of heterogenetic people, and dealing with extremely stressing situations where personal physical security was at risk. I look for resolving problems from the onset and always looking to facilitate the work to others.

I value teamwork, always willing to listen, learn and teach. I embrace nonviolent communication (NVC) in my communication and relationships of any kind. I'm motivated, optimistic, patient with high emotional self-control. I have empathy and the capacity to understand people based on their needs.

I'm used to fast paced environments, but I no longer aim for them, nor I think they're beneficial for the long-term personal wellness of the team. Instead I look for long-term sustainability. A good team is small, self-organized, responsive, works asynchronous and remote but has space for empathy and physical meetups.
