## Skills

**Management**  
I've founded an grown company with all it implies: seeking funding, product management, building long term strategies, finding product-market fit, unifying product and protocol development. Define: product roadmap, internal operations, communication, processes, external communication guidelines, and methodologies to keep them relevant and on track... Used and implemented Agile and Scrum systems.

**Teamwork**  
I'm used to fast paced environments, but I no longer aim at the cost of long-term personal wellness of the team. Instead I look for long-term sustainability. A good team is small, self-organized, responsive, works asynchronous and remote but has space for empathy and physical meetups. I've led many projects, developing good skills for organizing all sort of heterogenetic people. I look for resolving problems from the onset and always looking to facilitate the work to others. I value teamwork, always willing to listen, learn and teach. I embrace [Nonviolent Communication (NVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication) in my communication and relationships of any kind, trying to understand the other's needs before focusing on the message. I'm motivated, optimistic, patient with high emotional self-control and I appreciate similar qualities in my colleagues.

**Development**  
Web3: Ethereum, IPFS, IPLD; Solidity, Truffle  
Frontend: Typescript, Dart (Flutter), Javascript (React, Mocha, NPM…)  
Game development: Unity3D, C#, Haxe (Open FL)  
Creative: C++ (OpenFrameworks), ActionScript 3, Processing, Arduino  

**User experience**  
I'm motivated by products that enable its users to do more. I look for accessibility and minimalism without sacrificing optionality. For most projects I've had a mix role of front-end developer + UI/UX lead designer such as [Vocdoni's App UI](https://www.figma.com/file/e0KoX2m1aHM14sd6rLtPynRU/Vocdoni-App?node-id=3356%3A182),  mobile and social games, [Ludovico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDI82fS5Kd8) or [metadata concept app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZOW3OdPNXA&index=5&list=UUoRJpJaBBiGYqKxzlUBRNfA&t=35s)

## Personal ethics

For the last 6 years I've worked exclusively on projects that are 100% open-source and focused on empowering the individual and civil society.

My exclusive focus is the long term development of [Interplanetary mind-map](https://github.com/interplanetarymindmap/docs) and the creation of a foundational framework to sustain it. I'm currently publishing and experimenting with it using [my site as a first prototype](https://xavivives.com/#?expr=[%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3clzfmhs7a%22,[[%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3c2lf4dbua%22,%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3cwx4lcc2a%22],[%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3c2lf4dbua%22,%22i12D3KooWBSEYV1cK821KKdfVTHZc3gKaGkCQXjgoQotUDVYAxr3cmy3c4u4a%22]]]&).

The experience building [Vocdoni](https://github.com/vocdoni) requires a special mention for how brutally intense it was. As co-founder and CEO of Vocdoni I drove the project a small hacktivist group we grew up to a 15 people company, developing the first fully trust-less voting protocol and deployed it in numerous production settings. Vocdoni grew up in a extremely hostile environment with an constant fear of physical and digital safety due to the Spanish government censorship and prosecution. Me and my co-founder were targets of the [CatalanGate espionage scandal](https://catalonia.citizenlab.ca/) by the Spanish Government using NSO Group and Candiru spyware. That experience shaped me as a person an professional. Vocdoni got acquired by [Aragon Association](https://aragon.org/aragon-association) in 2021 and soon after I was forced out the project do to very strong differences in its vision and ethics.

Transparency is a requirement on any project I work, and I've left the most financially rewarding projects because of that. I'm driven by purpose, sometimes at my personal cost and I'm not looking at economic reward at the cost of others. I'm not ok participating in the VC model nor in forced crypto-token projects masked with beautified narrative of decentralization, or any model that exploits users attention or privacy.
