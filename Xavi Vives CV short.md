#### Personal
For the last two years I've worked exclusively on projects that are 100% open-source and focused on empowering the individual and civil society.

In the past I've led several projects, developing good skills for motivating people. I look for resolving problems from the onset and always looking to facilitate the work to others. Transparency is a requirement on any project I work.

I value teamwork, always willing to listen, learn and teach. Motivated, optimistic, patient and with self-control. I have empathy and the capacity to understand people and what they want.

Used to fast paced environments, with the Agile framework, always trying to keep things lean and well prioritized. Self-organized and responsive. Most of latest projects have been in remote with distributed teams.
