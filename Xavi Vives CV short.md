# Xavier Vives Riba

### Designer and developer
Most of the projects I been part of require a mix between design skills and technical knowledge, which is the area where I really enjoy working on. 

In last few years my main area of interest has focused on decentralized technologies, and what they can enable technically but especially for the social-economic side of it.
