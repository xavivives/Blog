Yesterday Sunday 21th I had my last meal. For the following days I'll live only on **distilled water**.
The overall idea its to keep doing a normal life and see how its effected.
Other than working +8h a day in front of a computer I'll be doing my normal runs and workouts and try to keep track of everything I can.

##Why?
When I [ran the 50k after few days of fasting](http://blog.xavivives.com/post/134198815248/running-50km-after-82h-of-fasting-my-conclusions), the experiment was pretty much to see if it was duable or not from an energetic stand point. This time its about everything else. But there are few things I'm specially interested in finding out:

- **General feelings**, body reactions and what feedback it provides. 
- **Effects on running** when there is a lack of **electrolytes**. 
- Effects in general when **no micronutrients are ingested**. 
- What's my **fat burning rate** on my daily basis and in consequence what its my daily **energy expenditure**. 

##Body measurements
Every morning I'm checking my **weight** and **body fat** after going to the bathroom. The second one its quite tricky.

I'm measuring the body fat using the [*Jackson & Pollock* 3 site skinfold formula](http://www.topendsports.com/testing/density-jackson-pollock.htm). The reasons is because all of the checking points are in the front of the body I can test it without needing anyone else. I'm doing the mesurments on the left and right side and averging them.
So far the results seem to low. I'm getting about 5% of body fat. If I had to judge visually I'll probably say that I'm about at 10%. I've made sure that I'm mesuring the right way and that the formula its correct.
The results seem consistent so I'll be keeping the same method for now.

I'm also logging the body fat percentage using a bioelectrical impedance scale although in the past its results seemed completly unreliable.

I'm also taking a front and side pictures to see how my body changes. I'm taking them in the evening (so I have control of the lighting) and before any kind of workout, to not inflate the muscles.

##Analysis
12h after the last meal I got my blood drawn and provided an urine sample. (Will put a link on all the biomarkers I'm checking soon).
Will put the results into the log when I get them.
Another analysis will be done at the end of the experiment.

##Logging
I'm using google forms to input the data but I'm also editing them directly to provide aditional data such as links. [Check out the spreadseet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UQPrhwwYjTwiHFrJld90puwU0neW8Cga6Hk4Q-75inQ/pubhtml):

I'm logging pretty much everything that I believe can give context and provide information on how the whole thing evolves. Probably I'll add some graphs as well.

**Drink**: I'm moving around with 650ml bottle of water. I'm logging everytime I finish it. Same if I use some other container
Feeling: How do I feel?: Hungry, tired, sleepy...
**Picture**: As said before I'll try to take daily pictures and see how my body changes.
**Run**: I'll put the Strava link.
**Workout**: I usually do a 20 min high intensity workout at home. I also go to the rock climbing gym a couple times a week. Will specify.
**Food**: I've logged my intake for the days before starting the fasting. That shouldn't be in use anymore.
**Pee**: Every time I go to pee. And if there is anything anormal in it. This one its hard to remember to do every time and I believe I missed a couple of times already.
**Poo**: Self explanatory.
**Analysis**: Just as for the timestamp reference.
**Day summary**: General feelings of the day.
**Mesurement**: Body weight, and fat percentage.

##End
There is no specific date for concluding the experiment. It will end when something goes wrong, when I get tired (its quite a pain to not eat and also track all this...) or some other major force interfiere on it.
It its not the goal to see how long I can last.
